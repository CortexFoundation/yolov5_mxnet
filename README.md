Introduction


This repo includes training yolov5 model in MXNET framework, model quantization and conversion on Cortex CVM Runtime mothodology. The code is revised from https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 as MXNET version, so as to do Cortex MRT quantization which could implement deterministic on-chain inference on fixed-point model uploaded.
